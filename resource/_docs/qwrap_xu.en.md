Introduction to QWrap: Preface
The realm of front-end engineering has been big, so are the number of frameworks.[QWrap](http://www.qwrap.com/) was originally created as part of a specific project, but when it became more and more stable, the idea to make it an asset of the whole industry emerged within the QWrap team. In second half of 2010, QWrap was moved to github to faciliate exchange of ideas with friends of the team. In late January 2011, the QWrap site opened, and it has been two months since then. Feedbacks and comments from folks in the community are never-ending, and we are especillay moved by those that are long and frank.

As a baby project, documents about QWrap are still insufficent. We have a rough introduction to the desion of QWrap - http://dev.qwrap.com/resource/js/_docs/QWrap-Design.ppt, but perhaps it is too vague and unclear, people who are interested in QWrap directly inspect and play with the code from [github](https://github.com/wedteam/qwrap) or qwrap-downlaod(http://www.qwrap.com/download.html). "QWrap is yet another wheel," said some folks who simply glance through some documents, and comments on QWrap are mostly limited on retouch/wrap or various ideas on the helper. No one views QWrap as a whole.

People who get to know QWrap from the code might find QWrap hard to understand, especillay those intrigued by keywords such as "functional programming". They either couldn't walk through helper.h.js, the pinch, or leave after walking through it. There image remains in those specific features.

Therefore, we decided to write a series of articles on introduction to QWrap, not as pieces of codes but some ideas and goals. In fact, looking at the implementation after learning the goals and ideas, you'll find QWrap simple and natural.
